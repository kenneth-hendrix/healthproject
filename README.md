# Health Website
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our health is the most important aspect of our lives because without good health all other aspects become less significant. By creating a more informed environment around us, we as a society can all live healthier lives. This includes educating our society on how to identify signs of health issues early before they escalate and how to react in times of emergency. Informing everyone of vaccines and shots that are available nearby or what current foods in supermarkets are causing sickness also promote a healthier environment.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introducing **A Health Reminder a Day Keeps the Doctor Away**. Through this social media website, daily reminders on current and applicable health topics will be presented. This information will be useful for users of all ages and health levels. The main goal is to educate everyone around us in a fun and simple way. In turn, hopefully users will be able to use this information to improve their health and the health of their community. Reminders will help people look for signs of preventable diseases and health concerns, such as looking for signs of stroke or heart attack in older family members, simple reminders to get flu shots/stay up to date on vaccinations, and advice on what to do during emergencies.<br /> <br />
